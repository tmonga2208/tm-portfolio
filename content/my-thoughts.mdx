## For You

For You I Would've Done Everything \
When I Close My Eyes I see You Like They're Still Open \
If You Want to Come Back ,The Door's Not Locked Yet.
Hold Me Tightly Before I Close The Door.


I'll fulfill your every wish , even if it's my death. \
Your Name Will Still Escape as my Last Breath.

I Don't Want To Find Someone Better, I Wanted You and Me To Become Better Together.

I'll Wait For You Even If It Takes Forever.


Promises have lost My trust ,They give me Hollow Hopes while from Inside I Rust.\
"I Will Always Love You Forever" \
Oh The Good Old Promise. But Then You Left , and You Did'nt Even Fight For "Us".
